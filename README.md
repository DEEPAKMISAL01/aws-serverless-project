  - title: ✨ Features
    content: |
      - **Serverless**: No servers to provision or manage.
      - **Scalable**: Built to handle variable workloads automatically.
      - **Cost-Effective**: Pay only for what you use.
      - **API Gateway**: Provides RESTful endpoints.
      - **AWS Lambda**: Backend logic without servers.

  - title: 🛠️ Architecture Overview
    content: |
      - **API Gateway**: Receives HTTP requests.
      - **Lambda Functions**: Executes business logic.
      - *(Optional)* **DynamoDB / S3**: For data persistence or storage.
      - **IAM Roles**: Secure permission management.
